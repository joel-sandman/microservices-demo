# Experiments

Firstly, run the `cluster.sh` script to set up a minikube instance with 4 CPU cores, 10 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Then run `run-experiments.sh` from within the `experiments/` directory to produce results. The results are then stored in a new folder called `results/`.

The `cluster.sh` and `run-experiments.sh` scripts are based on scripts by Lars Larsson, and can be found [here](https://github.com/llarsson/hipster-shop/tree/cache-estimation/experiments) in their original form.
